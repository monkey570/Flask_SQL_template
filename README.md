## What:

This is a very simple template for a web app with a backend in Python's Flask and Flask_SQLAlchemy, through which you can execute SQL queries after initiating a connection to your database.

I hope this benefits you and saves you the time it took me to make this, as I'm not a professional developer. If you see any improvements to be made to this simple template, let me know.

Best of luck and happy coding!

## How:

1. Navigate to the <i>connection_config_sample.txt</i> file and change the URI to reflect your database-related information
 (user, password, etc). Remove the word 'sample' from the filename as well.

2. Open the command line interface (CLI).

3. In the CLI, type <b>'py app.py'</b> or <b>'python app.py'</b>, and run.

That's it!

<b>Note:</b> Before uploading your project onto your GitHub or sharing it anywhere, go to your <i>.gitignore</i> file
and make sure that the last line pertaining to sharing the <i>connection_config.txt</i> file is included or not commented out.
You do not want to share this login/access information (obviously).
